What's COT data
=================================

Volume indicator is a very important indicator to confirm the trend, break, reverse, however the "Volume" indicator of MetaTrader 4 is not "real volume" indicator, it is just the tick volume of each interval (e.g. the number of ticks during the 30-minute period).

Commitments of Traders(COT) data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) can substitute the "Volume" indicator, as it provide the position and open interest information! It's very cool, though CFTC publishs the report once each week, and the data has a delay of three days.
